### This is Ray 👋

- I'm an incoming Data Engineer @ TD Bank, recently graduating from UofT.
- I learned Computer Science and Statistics @ UofT from 2018-2023. 
- While I have extensive experiences on ML, NLP and Data Science, I want to switch my focus on software engineering, data engineering and MLOps.

⚡ Fun fact: I love 🏀, 🍜, 🎮, and 🎬
